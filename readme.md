# SillyChatApp
> *A simple python chat app*

This is a simple chat application I wrote in python with RSA encryption and tcp sockets.

## Instillation
1. Clone or download the repository with `git clone https://github.com/jwe0/sillychat`
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python3 server.py` to setup the server on localhost port 5000
4. Run `python3 client.py [SERVER] [PORT] [USERNAME]` to join the server.
